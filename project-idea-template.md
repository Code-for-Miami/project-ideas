### Project management

#### Checklist for NEW ideas :baby:
Hey, you're official! You're now part of the growing civic hacking community in South Florida. Here's a few things to get started (a couple you've probably already done).

- [x] Create this idea issue
- [x] Flesh out the who, where, and what questions above
- [ ] Join our [Slack Group](http://cfm-invite.herokuapp.com/) and start the conversation!

#### Checklist for ACTIVE projects :fire:
Let's get this project started! When this idea starts taking off, the Projects Core Team will start helping this project's lead(s) out with project management and connecting you to resources you may need. To get there, please complete and check off the following:

- [ ] Take 30 minutes to complete [Open Leadership 101](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101) 
- [ ] Create a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/new). Ask for help setting up permissions if you want your repository to be within the [Code For Miami Github Organization](https://github.com/Code-for-Miami).
- [ ] Create a [README file](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) in your project repository. This file should help newcomers understand what your project is, why it's important, and kinds of help you're looking for.
- [ ] [Create issues](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/get-your-project-online/project-set-up-for-collaboration-with-github/#assignment--add-your-first-issue) to describe each task that you plan to do or need help with and how a contributor can get started on that task. You might start and stop a lot, so consider issues as your to-do list.
- [ ] Create a [team](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-team/) for your core contributors
  - This will make it easier for you to manage your github repo access. People on a team have the same level of access. Admin access will allow your trusted contributors to make changes as needed. 
  - You can remove and add people to your team as needed. 
  - Note: You can also allow collaborators outside of your team and give them more limited access.
- [ ]   Create a [user group](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212906697-User-Groups) in Slack so you can "@" your core contributors all at once, without bothering other people who use the Slack channel. You'll need permission from a Slack admin, so just mention @leadership on Slack to get this set up.
- [ ]   Create a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), or other cloud storage to share larger files. Github and Data.World are good for code and data, respectively, especially when you need version control. But they're not good for very large files, documentation, articles, etc. A cloud storage option will allow you to easily share, create, and collaborate on documents with your team and help organize ideas and thoughts.
  - Doing this early on can help your team stay organized and to onboard new contributors who wouldn't have access to files you all have shared over email.

#### Checklist for FEATURED Projects :tada:
To have your project FEATURED on [codefor.miami](http://codefor.miami/), complete the following documentation. In past projects, well-documented featured projects have more contributions than other projects.

- [ ] [Create file: LICENSE](http://choosealicense.com/) to give your project an open license, allowing for sharing and remixing.
- [ ] [Create file: CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozsprint-repo-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) so others know [how they can contribute](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/).
-- [ ] In your README, link to the [Code For Miami Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Code-for-Miami/codeofconduct/blob/master/README.md) or write your own code of conduct.
- [ ] Create an easily shareable project management artifact, like an [Open Canvas](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/develop-an-open-project-strategy-with-open-canvas/)
- [ ] [Tell Code For Miami](http://codefor.miami/projects). If your idea is in a shareable format and can benefit people around the city, go to that site and follow the instructions on the bottom of the page to showcase your work there.


If you get stuck at any point, feel free to reach out to the leadership team on Slack by adding @leadership to your message. We're here to help you make real changes to our city.
